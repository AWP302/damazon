Damazon

Damazon is a basic e-commerce storefront created using a MySQL database and a javascript node application. 

Customers are presented with a list of items, prices and quantities available and are prompted to enter the ID number of the item they wish to purchase as well as the number of units of each item. See ImageOne.

Customers choose items they wish to purchase as well as the number of units of each item. Customers are asked after each purchase whether they would like to make another purchase until they respond "no" and are checked out. See ImageTwo.

When the next customer "logs in" quantities of each item are adjusted based on purchases made by the previous cusomter. See ImageThree and note the adjusted quantities for items 1 and 7.
